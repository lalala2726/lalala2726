**Welcome to my Github home page. I am a computer major student from Xi'an, China. I hope my technology can help you.**

### Little More About Me  

I am keen on listening to music, cooking and reading, and I also like to accompany music when programming. I fervently hope that my technology can bring people the convenience of science and technology, as a famous saying that I like very much said: "so that everyone can enjoy the fun of technology."
